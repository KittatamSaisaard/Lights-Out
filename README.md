# Lights-Out
 Lights Out Mobile Game made using Unity 3D and C#.
 
 To win the game, the user must turn all of the lights off by having all tiles be white.
 
 The user can select their desired level (grid size). The level number, n, will generate a grid of nxn tiles.

 The user can alter the view of the game by using 2 fingers to pinch and zoom in and out or drag to move around. There is a reset zoom button at the bottom of the game to reset the view.
 
 When a user taps on a tile, the current and adjacent tiles (top, left, bottom, right) will turn off or on based on the current state the current tile is in. For example, if the current tile is on and a user taps on it, the current and adjacent tiles will turn off.
